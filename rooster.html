                            largest number of fans and followers of the Fortnite competitive scene, former Team Liquid
                            player and currently retired, he managed to play a very good role in this great game that
                            even after 5 years since its creation it continues to be one of the best video games related
                            to eSports competition.

                            competitions. He ranks second in total career earnings in Fortnite in the Netherlands, right
                            behind Dave "Rojo" Jong.

                            While Dimitri made a lot of money from the battle royale game, the truth is that he hasn't
                            been very successful lately, which may have been the reason why he decided to quit it. In
                            the last two years, Mitr0 has made only $7,500 from Fortnite tournaments, a far cry from the
                            $77,500 he made in 2022 and almost half a million dollars in 2019.</p>
