                <h2>WHAT IS COUNTER STRIKE GLOBAL OFFENSIVE?</h2>
                <p> <strong>Counter-Strike <strong class="cursive">(CS)</strong></strong> is a series of
                    <strong>multiplayer tactical first-person shooter</strong> video games in which
                    teams of <strong>terrorists</strong> battle to perpetrate an act of terror (bombing, hostage-taking,
                    assassination)
                    while <strong>counter-terrorists</strong> try to prevent it (bomb defusal, hostage rescue, escort
                    mission). The
                    series began on Windows in 1999 with the release of the first game, <strong
                        class="cursive">Counter-Strike.</strong> It was initially
                    released as a modification <strong>("mod")</strong> for Half-Life that was designed by Minh <strong
                        class="cursive">"Gooseman"</strong> Le and Jess
                    <strong>"Cliffe"</strong> Cliffe before the rights to the mod's intellectual property were acquired
                    by Valve, the
                    developers of Half-Life, who then turned Counter-Strike into a retail product released in 2000.
                </p>

                <h3>Why Counter Strike Is Still Succeeding In Esports?</h3>
                <p>In the <strong>electronic sports industry</strong>, where everything happens with tremendous speed,
                    it is surprising
                    to see actors, whether they are players, competition organizers or disciplines that last over time.
                    That is precisely the curious case of <strong>Counter-Strike</strong>, a game that, in its different
                    versions, has
                    been one of the flagships of esports since <strong>1999</strong>.</p>

                <p>This shooter, which began its journey in the video game ecosystem as an addition, a
                    modification of the <strong>historic Half-Life</strong>, soon acquired its own share of prominence
                    to be
                    released individually.

                    Such was the irruption of Counter-Strike in the embryonic esports scene that with just a
                    year of life, in <strong>August 2000</strong> it was already the main attraction of a competitive
                    circuit that
                    It ended up becoming an icon of electronic sports in the first decade of the <strong>21st
                        century</strong>, the <strong>CPL</strong>.
                </p>

                <h3>The golden era of Counter-Strike in esports</h3>

                <p>The growth, both in the mass of players and in the follow-up of the <strong>tournaments</strong>, was
                    exponential and
                    constant throughout its first decade of life, counting as its peak of maximum splendor around the
                    years <strong>2007</strong> and <strong>2008</strong>, a moment when great players in the current
                    ecosystem, like ESL, with their
                    <strong>Intel Extreme Masters</strong> they showcased the <strong
                        class="cursive">Counter-Strike</strong> spectacle all over the world with major
                    competitions.
                </p>
                <p>While its <strong>"modern"</strong> version, <strong class="cursive">Counter-Strike: Source</strong>,
                    grew and discussed the acquisition of new members
                    for its community in parallel, nothing seemed to shake the foundations of the reign of the original.
                    However, the years passed and tedium and an already outdated graphics engine made it decline in
                    relevance within the world of esports at the same time that new titles originally focused on that
                    sector appeared.
                </p>
                <p>Its worst moment coincided with the beginning of the development of the current version,
                    <strong class="cursive">Counter-Strike: Global Offensive</strong>, designed to recover the throne
                    and which perhaps came a little
                    late. Around the year <strong>2010</strong>, the following of the competitions and the user base
                    <strong>decreased
                        dramatically</strong> and it was not until 2012 that the now acclaimed CSGO was launched.
                </p>
                <p>The beginnings were not easy, the market share in <strong class="cursive">Counter-Strike
                        esports</strong> was low, which implied a
                    development of the competitive ecosystem much slower than desired. Something that ESL and <a
                        class="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DreamHack">Dreamhack</a>,
                    the main exponents of the organization of competitions years ago, saw as an opportunity to continue
                    being leaders in the sector. The bet did not cease at any time and proof of this is that <strong
                        class="cursive">today they
                        make up the most prestigious competitive circuit on the calendar.</strong></p>
