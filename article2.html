                <h2>WHAT IS VALORANT?</h2>
                <p> It is a <strong>5v5 multiplayer first person shooter (FPS)</strong> where one team attacks and the
                    other defends. The
                    main game mode, <strong>Search and Destroy</strong>, is very <strong>similar to CS:GO</strong>. The
                    attacking team's goal is to plant
                    a bomb <strong>(called a spike)</strong> and cause it to detonate, while the defending team tries to
                    avoid it.
                    Regardless of whether to wage war or not, if a squadron is eliminated before any other victory
                    condition is met, the opposing squadron will win.</p>

                <p>Matches last for <strong>25 rounds</strong>, each lasting <strong>100 seconds</strong>. The first
                    team to win 13 rounds wins the match
                    overall. At the start of the round, you will have <strong>30 seconds to purchase weapons and
                        equipment</strong> for
                    that round. If you die in a round, you will have to wait until the next one for that round. If you
                    die in a round. You will have to wait until the next round to respawn. This main game mode can be
                    played in ranked or unranked matches.</p>

                <h3>Valorant: The keys to the game that will revolutionize eSports</h3>
                <p>The commentator and professional player <strong class="cursive">Ulises Prieto</strong> almost speaks
                    of obsession. <strong class="cursive">"I think Valorant
                        has hit the key</strong>, it's been years since I've come across a game that I literally go to
                    bed thinking
                    about," says this veteran <strong>eSports caster</strong>. "While I'm sleeping, my partner has come
                    to tell me that I
                    tap on his leg," he adds.</p>

                <p>The new video game from the <strong>American company Riot Games</strong>, the creators of the
                    acclaimed <strong>League of
                        Legends (LoL)</strong>, can have this effect on many players. It is a <strong>tactical
                        first-person shooter</strong> similar
                    to the popular and <strong>classic Counter Strike</strong>, but with different characters and unique
                    powers. It is
                    not quite a MOBA, a type of video game in which the abilities of each champion define the way of
                    playing, like Dota or LoL itself, although it does take some elements of the genre. If you know how
                    to shoot, you'll be fine, but you'd better use all the powers at your disposal.
                </p>

                <p>The players' first contact with Valorant was between Friday, <strong>March 27</strong>, and Sunday,
                    <strong>March 29</strong>, in an
                    online event in which La Vanguardia was able to participate along with hundreds of <strong
                        class="cursive">professional
                        players, streamers, and journalists from around the world</strong>. In those three days of
                    testing, it became
                    clear that <strong>Riot Games</strong> goal was to create the next great eSport, a new video game
                    that would force
                    itself into the most competitive scene in electronic sports.
                </p>
                <p>Being in the closed <strong>beta phase</strong>, as of <strong>April 7</strong>, Valorant has
                    achieved exceptional results thanks to
                    being a solid product that the public liked and the <strong>collaboration between Riot Games and
                        Twitch</strong>, the
                    main video game streaming platform. If you wanted to enter this testing phase, you had to watch
                    streams of the game on this Amazon platform. It was not necessary to see many hours, but you know...
                    People tend to sin more by excess than by default.
                </p>
                <p><strong>Since the beginning of April</strong>, the numbers have decreased. For several weeks it
                    remained around
                    <strong>700,000 viewers</strong> with thousands of streamers around the world spending half the day
                    live. "I don't do
                    <strong>6, 7 or 8 hours live</strong> because I want to be live, I do them because I want to spend 8
                    hours playing,"
                    says Prieto.
